- Hi, I’m @b1tbucket, or Tom.
- My passions and interests vary greatly, but I have a true knack for software development and UI design. Recently I've been looking into artificial intelligence and have been developing my own intuitive, all-encompassing desktop assistant using Java and JavaFX.
- I've used Java for development since 2015, and have started looking more into Python within the past year.
- If you have any suggestions or are willing to teach me anything about neural networks or artificial intelligence, please reach out!
- The easiest way to contact me is my email, tom@linteau.com
- Happy coding!
